                                TheyGotFit is a tool inspired by <a href = "http://reddit.com/r/progresspics" target = "_blank">/r/progresspics</a>. I wrote it after being frustrated by looking through page after page for people with my weight who have made the transformation I wanted to make. TheyGotFit allows you to enter your current and desired height and weight and shows you photos of other people who've undergone the same tranformation. You can also maintain upload an maintain a profile of your own fitness progress.

                                Bossfight is a collaborative multiplayer text-based game I built with <a href = "http://jamesmayr.com" target = "blank">James Mayr.</a> In this game, players join together to defeat a fearsome dragon, taking turn based actions as the story lays out in from of them. Attack exhaustion and group-healing mechanics lead players to strategically work together rather than repeatedly attacking each turn.
